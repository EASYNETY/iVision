Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Authentication Flow:

Login: The user must enter credentials (username/password) or use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for added security.

Authorization: Upon successful login, the system checks the user’s role and grants access accordingly (Admin, Agency User, Viewer, etc.).

Role Types:

Agency Admin: Full access to all data and management options within their sector, can manage users, permissions, and access logs.

Agency User: Limited access, allowing them to view, add, update, and delete relevant user data based on their sector. No access to modify user roles or global settings.

Viewer: A read-only role for observing the data without the ability to make any modifications.

Audit Trail:

Tracking User Actions:

Every action performed by users (add, update, delete, view) is logged.

Information recorded for each action:

Action Type: (Create, Update, Delete, View)

User: Who performed the action

Timestamp: When the action occurred

Module/Section: Where the action took place (Justice, Banking, etc.)

IP Address/Location: From which IP and location the action was performed

Old and New Data: For updates or deletions, both the previous and new values will be stored.

Agency Dashboard:

Agency Admin Dashboard Features:

User Management: Create, update, or delete agency users. Assign and manage user roles within their sector.

Access Logs: View all actions performed by users in their agency.

Statistics & Reporting: Generate reports for their sector (e.g., active users, number of records processed, etc.).

User Data Search: Search for user records across different modules (Justice, Banking, Humanitarian, etc.).

Alerts & Notifications: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access or failed login attempts.

Agency User Dashboard Features:

Relevant Data Views: View and manage user data relevant to their sector (e.g., only banking information for a banking user).

Search Filters: Easily search for users based on specific criteria (e.g., criminal records, voting eligibility, etc.).

Identity Matching: Use AI or rule-based matching to find potentially matching identities across different modules.

View/Update Identity: When a match is found, display options for the user to view the matched identity details and update the data in relevant modules.

Export Data: Export user data or reports in multiple formats (CSV, PDF).

Sector-Specific Modules:

Justice Module:

Criminal Records Search: Ability to search for criminal records associated with a user by their name or other identifiers.

Criminal Record Update: If there’s new data or updates, users can edit records as appropriate.

Criminal History Alerts: Alerts for any newly added criminal records for a user.

Banking Module:

Banking History Search: View user banking history, including account balances, transactions, and associated institutions.

Fraud Detection: Flag suspicious transactions or banking activity for further investigation.

Bank Account Update: Option to update banking details, such as account status or institution changes.

Humanitarian Module:

Aid Distribution History: Track the distribution of humanitarian aid to a user, including received items, amounts, and dates.

Eligibility Check: Cross-reference users with humanitarian aid eligibility criteria and provide feedback or warnings.

Identity Verification for Aid: Option for users to update their identity if new personal information is available or if discrepancies are found.

Voting Module:

Voter Registration Status: Check if a user is registered to vote and whether they are eligible for upcoming elections.

Voting History: View the user’s voting history, including past elections and voting status.

Update Voting Information: Ability to update a user’s voting status or personal data if there’s a change (e.g., address change).

ID Card Module:

ID Verification: Verify the identity of users based on official ID card information.

ID Card Issuance and Updates: Manage the issuance and updates of ID cards.

Real-time ID Status: Update ID status in real-time, reflecting any changes to a user’s eligibility or status (e.g., revoked, updated).

Transportation Module:

Vehicle Registration: Manage user vehicle data (e.g., car registration details, license plates).

Transport Violations: Track any violations or penalties linked to the user.

Transport History: View and manage the user’s transportation history (e.g., public transport usage or vehicle-related records).

Identity Matching & Data Integrity:

Matching Process:

Automatic Identity Matching: Use AI and machine learning to automatically match user identities across different modules (e.g., a single user record across justice, banking, voting, etc.).

Manual Matching: When a match is found, the system should provide a "View Identity" button to allow the user to inspect matched data and decide whether to merge or update records.

Update Options: Provide a detailed view of the matched identity and offer options to update or modify user data across all modules. Changes should be logged and updated in the audit trail.

Additional Features:

Advanced Search: Allow users to search across multiple modules using advanced filters (e.g., user’s age, address, criminal history, etc.).

Notifications & Alerts: Set up user-specific or role-based notifications for actions such as updates to their personal data or when specific thresholds are met (e.g., a criminal record match).

Mobile-Friendly Interface: The system should be mobile responsive, allowing agency users and admins to access the dashboard and manage data from any device.

Integration with External Systems: Integrate the platform with external systems like government databases, national crime records, and financial institutions to provide real-time updates and data synchronization.

Compliance & Security:

Ensure the system complies with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Use encryption at rest and in transit to protect sensitive data.

Implement role-based encryption to ensure that only authorized users can access specific data.

User Flow Example:
Login:

Agency User logs in using their credentials and passes the MFA check.

The system assigns the correct role based on their credentials (e.g., Agency User).

The user lands on their dashboard, which displays only the relevant modules (e.g., Banking, Humanitarian).

Identity Matching:

The Agency User enters a name or ID to search for a user.

The system automatically searches across modules (Justice, Banking, Voting, etc.).

A match is found across the Banking and Justice modules.

The user clicks on the "View Identity" button to inspect the match.

The user decides to update the criminal record in the Justice module and update the user’s banking information in the Banking module.

The system logs all updates and actions in the audit trail.

Audit Trail:

The agency admin can access the audit trail to see that the user performed actions on the criminal record and banking details.

The admin can view who performed the action, what changes were made, and from which location.

User Data Management:

Agency Admin can create a new user or modify existing user roles.

Admin views the aggregated data and can generate reports based on sector-specific data (e.g., banking transactions, criminal records, etc.).
