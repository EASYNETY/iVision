1. Integrating RBAC with Facial Recognition
User Authentication and Roles:

Enhance the current authentication system by adding user roles (Admin, Agency User, Viewer).

Use facial recognition for initial authentication, and then assign different access levels (via RBAC) based on the user’s role.

Each user’s facial data could be linked to their assigned role in the system to ensure only authorized individuals can access sensitive modules or perform specific actions.

Role Management:

Add a user management interface where Admins can assign and modify roles for users, linking each user’s role to their facial recognition profile. For example, when an Admin updates a user's role, the corresponding access rights (e.g., permissions to access specific modules) should be automatically applied.

2. Audit Trail with Facial Recognition Integration
Tracking User Actions:

Log every action performed within the facial recognition system, such as user identification, image uploads, updates, etc., alongside the user’s facial profile.

Maintain an audit trail that includes:

Who performed the action (linked to their facial profile)

What action was performed

Timestamp and location of the action

Details of the changes made, if any (e.g., updated image, role change, etc.)

This will help track both the access and any changes made to facial recognition data, ensuring a robust audit system.

3. Sector-Specific Modules (Justice, Banking, etc.)
Face-Linked Data Access:

Allow users to access different sector-specific modules (Justice, Banking, Humanitarian, etc.) based on their assigned role.

When a user is authenticated through facial recognition, the system checks their role and provides access to the relevant modules. For example, an Admin might have access to all modules, while a Banking user would only see banking-related data.

If a user's facial data matches records from multiple sectors, the system can prompt them to view the relevant matched identities and update them accordingly.

4. Identity Matching Across Modules
Facial Recognition and Data Linkage:

Integrate facial recognition with data across different modules (Justice, Banking, Voting, etc.). When a user’s face is detected and matched to a record in any module, the system should provide an option to view and update the matched identity across all relevant modules.

This identity matching could be automatically triggered whenever a new user is registered in the system or when they log in for the first time.

5. User Interface/Experience
Dashboard with Role-Specific Views:

Provide a clean, modern dashboard for both Agency Admins and Users. The dashboard should display only the relevant information based on the user's role and sector.

Admin users should have the ability to view all data and manage other users, while regular users (e.g., Agency Users) should only see and manage data relevant to their assigned role.

6. Privacy & Security Considerations:
Since facial recognition involves sensitive data, ensure that all facial data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.

Implement a secure storage for facial data, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

Only authorized roles (e.g., Admin) should be able to access facial data for training or updating purposes, and there should be clear audit logs of who accesses the data and when.

7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
You could enhance the security of the facial recognition system by incorporating MFA. For example, after the user’s face is recognized, they may need to provide additional authentication (e.g., a PIN, OTP, or fingerprint) before accessing sensitive data or performing certain actions.

8. System Flexibility & Future Scalability
Ensure that the system is designed to scale as new modules or sectors (e.g., Transportation, ID Card) are added. The RBAC system should be flexible enough to integrate new modules and adjust user permissions accordingly without requiring major overhauls.

Next Steps:
Phase 1: Start by implementing the role-based authentication system, integrating facial recognition with role assignments. This will allow you to secure access to the system based on user roles.

Phase 2: Implement the audit trail system to track user actions, focusing on facial recognition-specific activities (e.g., image upload, user matches).

Phase 3: Integrate sector-specific modules and link them to user roles, ensuring that each user can only access data relevant to their sector.

Phase 4: Introduce identity matching capabilities across modules, using facial recognition data to link users’ identities across multiple sectors.

Phase 5: Focus on UI/UX improvements, providing role-based views on the dashboard for both Admins and Users.
